<h1 style="text-align: center;color:#1E90FF;font-size:50px;font-family:verdana;">Mitigation and Adaptation</h1>

<p>Climate change is one of the most complex issues facing all of humankind today. Wisconsin, like many other parts of the world, has also inevitably been hampered by the consequent climatic effects. In order to fight climate change, professionals from different disciplines at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are using their specialized knowledge to make contributions. Along the way, they have encountered various challenges and difficulties. However, they have never stopped exploring the most effective way to stop this global crisis in its tracks.</p>


<p>UW-Madison has adopted two different approaches to respond to the changing climate. One way is mitigating the impact, which refers to addressing climate change from the root causes. People can achieve it by constructing more energy-saving campus buildings, for example. The other way is adapting to the consequences of climate change. The goal is forecasting the future climate and possible detrimental effects, taking action to prevent unfavorable outcomes from happening.</p>


<p>Engineers from UW-Madison are pursuing the first approach by renovating new school buildings and restoring outdated facilities in order to meet the standards of <a href="https://yuheituer777.wordpress.com/2020/11/09/mitigation-and-adaptation/">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</a>. Over ten buildings on campus were successfully certified by the LEED program, which provides a framework to become environment-friendly, highly-efficient, and sustainable buildings. One of the major criteria LEED uses to assess a building is whether it is energy-saving enough.</p>

<p>“Part of the energy aspect of LEED is that they do have a minimum requirement, so it requires that you do better than the minimum energy code,” said Joy Altwies, a Professional Engineer with a research interest in green and high-performance buildings. “It at least pushes project owners to pay more attention to the energy aspects and to value the future energy use of that building while they’re designing it and while they’re building it.”</p>

<p>Until now, the Education Building is the only building at UW-Madison to have received Platinum Certification, the highest <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/leed">rating in the LEED program</a>. Maybe thousands of students pass this iconic building on the way to class without knowing this fact.</p>

<p>The Education Building was almost 110 years old when the renovations were completed. Afterward, it became an extremely energy-efficient building designed with large windows to capture natural daylight, according to Angela Pakes, a Licensed Professional Engineer who has successfully led several LEED projects.</p>

<p>“It (Education Building) is also the state very first Energy Star-rated building, so Energy Star is a rating that gives for appliances that are high-efficient appliances,” said Pakes.</p>

<p>However, there is some controversy about the effectiveness of LEED-certified buildings. John Davis, who has 21 years of experience in the building design and operation industry, is not entirely optimistic about this project.</p>

<p>Davis said that meeting the LEED standard requires the architectural and system design of renovated buildings to be more complicated. However, the maintenance staff is generally not skillful or knowledgeable enough to operate the renovated and more complicated structure.</p>

<p>“If we give somebody a tool to play with and it exceeds their skillset, guess what? We’re not going to do a very good job of operating, and we’re not going to do a very good job of maintaining that building,” said Davis.</p>

<p>Davis believes the school should invest in operating and maintaining our existing buildings on campus instead of pursuing LEED new buildings.</p>

<p>“If we focused on those buildings and brought them to the level they should be, that would have a much greater impact than pursuing LEED on these new buildings,” said Davis.</p>

<p>Besides mitigating climate change from the root causes, many scientists at UW-Madison have helped people adapt to and live with the current conditions and develop strategies to avoid possible destruction. An organization called the <a href="https://wicci.wisc.edu/">Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Effect (WICCI)</a> on campus is conducting research with this target in mind.</p>

<p>“We try to understand how climate is changing and how we can protect it or adapt to climate change, so how we can adjust our behaviors such that the negative impacts are not as bad,” said Michael Notaro, a member of the climate working group in WICCI.</p>

<p>Climate change has brought too many uncertainties to Wisconsin. Rising temperatures and irregular precipitation patterns are conspiring to make our local ecosystem more vulnerable—crop yields have reduced, the duration of ice cover on Lake Mendota has declined, and algal blooms occur more frequently, according to the WICCI report.</p>

<p>“The research that I’ve been doing is just made it more reinforced, both from observations and models, that climate change is occurring. Earth is warming. It’s related to human activities and that the climate is becoming more extreme,” said Notaro.</p>

<p>People cannot be caught unprepared by the uncertainties of the future, especially for those who have vested interests, for instance, the governments, businesses, and tribal organizations. These stakeholders should adopt conservation strategies or seek guidance in order to face the challenges ahead. Therefore, wise precautions and adaptation plans from specialists have little room for delay.</p>

<p>WICCI is committed to anticipating the harms and benefits that might occur to natural and human-made environments in the future, fostering strategies to mitigate risks and seize the opportunities. Stakeholders can use WICCI adaptation plans as guidance to weigh the impact of climate change and implement sensible strategies when making decisions and setting their agendas.</p>

<p>“We’ve given guidance to such companies like Alliant Energy, for example, they are interested, and they build new facilities that they make sure they’re able to handle,” said Notaro.</p>

<p>However, one large barrier for WICCI is greater difficulty in getting enough funding for more intensive research.</p>

<p>“I think now, in the last few years, it is getting harder and harder to get research grants. It’s very competitive, so any support at the university or state level would really be valuable in terms of seeing that the best science is being produced,” said Notaro.</p>

<p>Addressing climate change has always been a time-consuming and arduous undertaking. Although this is a road full of challenges and difficulties, unremitting attempts and exploration are always the best options. Combating climate change needs more than efforts of professionals. Students and staff in UW-Madison should also be alert to the impact of climate change and raise awareness about protecting the environment. As long as people take climate change seriously, our state will have a promising future.</p>
